Using an AI chatbot on the left side of the screen with a google map on the right side of the screen, we can chat to the chatbot asking for the location of whatever address we input, it would show us the area of the surroundings providing us with details of the location - like the gas stations around, schools, parks, companies, restaurants, cafes, bus stops, etc.
The AI would then group all this information together giving us a breif overview of the area telling us about the location - if it is a good fit for a person to live, or a family to live and it would ask for potential suggestions if needed. The AI would also provide potential suggesstions about the location - if it is a good fit for a person to live in the surrounding area. The AI would also provide crime statistics about the location - using historical data about the area. In a nutshell, it would tells us about the public areas around, community information (reviews) and form a suggestion/interpretation of whether it is a good fit for a person to live.
